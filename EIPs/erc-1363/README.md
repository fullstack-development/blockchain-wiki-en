# ERC-1363: Payable Token

**Author:** [Pavel Naydanov](https://github.com/PavelNaydanov) üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The ERC-1363 standard extends the functionality of the ERC-20 token by allowing the execution of code immediately after the `transfer()`, `transferFrom()`, or `approve()` functions within a single transaction. This standard helps to avoid double gas payment, as the additional call is made within the same transaction of the token transfer or approval.

Important! The ERC-1363 standard is an extension of the ERC-20 standard and is fully backward compatible. This means it does not override the standard functions `transfer()`, `transferFrom()`, or `approve()`.

The `IERC1363.sol` standard extends the token implementation of `ERC-20` with new functions.

```solidity
interface IERC1363 is IERC20, IERC165 {
  function transferAndCall(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
  function transferAndCall(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
  function transferFromAndCall(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
  function transferFromAndCall(address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
  function approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
  function approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
}
```

|```transferAndCall()```|```transferFromAndCall()```|```approveAndCall()```|
|-|-|-|
|Under the hood, it makes a standard function call to `transfer()`, and then makes an additional function call to the address of the **token recipient**.|Under the hood, it makes a standard function call to `transferFrom()`, and then makes an additional function call to the address of the **token recipient**.|Under the hood, it makes a standard function call to `approve()`, and then makes an additional function call to the address of the **entity granted permission** to use the token.|

>To execute code after calling `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`, the token recipient must be a **contract** and implement the `IERC1363Receiver.sol` interface.

>To execute code after calling `approve()`, the address that is granted permission to spend the token must be a **contract** and implement the `IERC1363Spender.sol` interface.

The implementation is based on ERC677Token, which inspired the creation of ERC-1363. The idea is very similar, but unfortunately, the standard has not been officially adopted.
