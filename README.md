Hey! We're the [MetaLamp team](https://www.metalamp.io/) 👋 Since 2014, we've been turning clients' ideas into finished products. Starting from 2020, we've been focusing on web3 projects and expanding our expertise, which we want to share with the community. 🚀

We already have an open-access [educational program for frontend/backend developers](https://github.com/fullstack-development/developers-roadmap) and a [web3 roadmap for non-developers](https://github.com/fullstack-development/web3-roadmap). And of course, following the MetaLamp tradition, we're sharing our knowledge base on writing smart contracts for EVM-compatible blockchains. 💡

This knowledge base was born out of real-world project challenges. We've transferred our experience into a comprehensive Wiki that reflects the expertise of our entire team of Solidity smart contract developers. 📚

We'd love to hear your feedback, contributions to the roadmap, and any kind of partnership opportunities. Let's grow together! 🌱✨
