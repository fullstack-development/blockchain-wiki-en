# Bittensor

**Author:** [Aleksei Kutsenko](https://github.com/bimkon144) üë®‚Äçüíª

[Bittensor](https://bittensor.com/) is a decentralized blockchain protocol designed for distributed exchange of computational power and intellectual resources. Its goal is to create an open and self-regulating ecosystem where participants can develop, train, and evaluate neural network models, earning rewards for their contributions.

The system is built using the [Substrate](https://polkadot-blockchain-academy.github.io/pba-book/substrate/intro/page.html) framework, developed by the creators of [Polkadot](https://polkadot.com/). 

Why Substrate instead of Ethereum? The choice of Substrate for Bittensor is based on several key advantages:
 1) **Specialization** ‚Äî the ability to create a fully customized blockchain for AI computations, rather than being limited by smart contract constraints;
 2) **Scalability** ‚Äî handling a large number of transactions between miners and validators without high fees;
 3) **Modularity** ‚Äî using ready-made components for rapid development;
 4) **Economic efficiency** ‚Äî predictable transaction costs, which are critical for constant data exchange in an AI network;
 5) **Autonomy** ‚Äî full control over protocol development without relying on third-party blockchain decisions.

> **Parachain** in the Polkadot ecosystem is a specialized blockchain that runs in parallel with the main Polkadot network (called the Relay Chain) and other parachains.

It's important to note that although Bittensor uses *Substrate* technologies, it operates as an independent blockchain and is not part of the Polkadot ecosystem as a *parachain*. This is a strategic decision by the Bittensor developers, allowing them to fully control their network and develop it according to their own vision, while still leveraging Substrate's powerful blockchain development tools.

The network‚Äôs main blockchain, **Subtensor**, operates on the [*Proof of Authority* (PoA)](https://coinmerce.io/en/learn/what-is-proof-of-authority/) consensus mechanism, where validation is carried out by trusted nodes under the control of the **Opentensor Foundation**.

A key feature of blockchain is its ability to coordinate participants without centralized control by using financial incentives. This enables the creation of self-regulating ecosystems where everyone acts in their own interest while simultaneously strengthening the network.

For example, in [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/), the mining mechanism serves as an incentive to secure the blockchain: when the price of BTC rises, miner rewards increase, attracting new participants and boosting the network‚Äôs security.

Bittensor adapts this principle for the artificial intelligence and distributed computing market. Instead of a fixed incentive system, the network uses a flexible market model where each subnet ecosystem manages its own economy.

Previously, the network used a single mechanism for evaluating miner performance ‚Äî [Yuma Consensus](https://docs.bittensor.com/yuma-consensus), which distributed TAO rewards based on the subjective evaluations of validators. However, this approach had elements of centralization: validators of the Root Subnet played a key role by controlling resource distribution.

In February 2024, Bittensor introduced [Dynamic TAO](https://docs.bittensor.com/dynamic-tao/) ‚Äî a new economic model that eliminated centralized control and made the network more dynamic and resilient. It works alongside Yuma Consensus, which was modified in the process. Now, rewards depend not only on validators but also on staking dynamics and the market value of TAO tokens. This means that the more TAO is staked in a subnet and the higher its market value, the greater the rewards participants receive.

This approach turns the development of AI models and computational processes into a self-regulating and economically driven process. In this way, Bittensor is creating not just a decentralized market for digital resources, but a new infrastructure for collaborative work on complex computational tasks.

## 1. How does the protocol work overall?

![alt text](./images/schem-1.png)

1. Users send a request through applications.  
2. The application or validator forms the request.  
3. Validators distribute tasks to miners.  
4. Miners send the results of their work to validators for verification and evaluation.  
5. The validator evaluates the result based on the standards of the subnet and interacts with the main blockchain to record the result and determine reward distribution.  
6. Sends the best result back to the application.

## 2. Blockchain Architecture

At the core of Bittensor are the Subtensor blockchain, the system of subnets, and the Bittensor API.
![alt text](./images/schem-2.png)

Thus, the following roles can be identified in the operation of the protocol:

- **Miners** ‚Äî Work on creating digital goods.  
- **Validators** ‚Äî Evaluate the quality of miners' work.  
- **Subnet creators** ‚Äî Manage the incentive mechanisms that define the tasks miners and validators must perform.  
- **Stakers** ‚Äî TAO holders can support specific validators in each subnet. By delegating their tokens to a validator, they increase its stake and later receive a share of its income.

Let‚Äôs look at each highlighted module in the diagram.

### 2.1 Subtensor ‚Äî the main blockchain of the network

In the architecture, the Subtensor blockchain functions as an immutable ledger, recording data about computational processes, transactions, and the performance results of network participants.

Functionality of the Bittensor (Subtensor) blockchain

The Bittensor economy is based on two types of tokens:
- **TAO** (œÑ) ‚Äî the native token of the network, used for *staking* and gas fees  
- **Alpha tokens** (Œ±) ‚Äî tokens specific to each *subnet*, used to track participant contributions

Main functions of Subtensor:
- Acts as an immutable ledger, recording data about computational processes, participant outputs, and validator evaluations  
- Records balances and transactions of all network participants  
- Enables staking ‚Äî users can delegate TAO to support specific validators in subnets  
- Supports TAO token transfers between addresses  
- Provides compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, opening the door for more complex applications such as liquid staking and TAO lending

It‚Äôs important to understand that the EVM blockchain does not allow interaction with subnets, meaning it cannot be used to request task execution.

### 2.2 Subnets

A subnet in Bittensor is a specialized platform for creating a specific type of digital product related to artificial intelligence. For example, one subnet may specialize in text generation, while another focuses on image processing.

**Subnet Structure**

Each subnet consists of the following components:

1. **Incentive Mechanism**:
   - Defines the tasks miners must perform and the quality standards applied to them  
   - Sets the rules for how validators evaluate miners' work and how rewards are distributed  
   - Regulates how miners and validators receive rewards  
   - Implemented as a codebase that defines the interfaces and rules of interaction between participants

2. **Participants**:
   - **Miners** ‚Äî perform computational tasks  
   - **Validators** ‚Äî verify and evaluate the results produced by miners  
   - **Subnet creators** ‚Äî develop and maintain the subnet‚Äôs operational mechanisms  

3. **Workflow**:
   - Miners receive and complete tasks  
   - Validators independently evaluate the results  
   - A rating matrix is generated for each miner  
   - Based on these evaluations, rewards are distributed

### 2.3 Bittensor SDK

Bittensor provides a powerful set of tools for working with the network, enabling decentralized management of computational resources and the development of new subnets.

The key tool for integrating with the network is the Bittensor SDK, which:
- Enables miners and validators to interact within subnets  
- Provides access to the Subtensor blockchain for data transmission and asset management  
- Automates transaction processing and computation tracking  

This is an open ecosystem for developers, where Bittensor provides:
- Source repositories and tools for working with the network  
- Detailed documentation describing the API and economic mechanisms  
- Step-by-step guides and tutorials for miners, validators, and subnet creators  

These tools allow developers to create new subnets, integrate with Bittensor, and interact with the Subtensor blockchain, helping to grow a decentralized AI infrastructure.

Now that we‚Äôve covered the overall network architecture, let‚Äôs look at how task processing works within subnets ‚Äî from request creation to reward distribution.

## 3. Technologies

It‚Äôs important to understand that reward distribution is based on Yuma Consensus and Dynamic TAO.

**What is Dynamic TAO?**

**Dynamic TAO** is a new way of determining the value of subnets through a market-driven mechanism: users can ‚Äúvote‚Äù for a subnet‚Äôs value by placing their tokens into its reserve.

![alt text](./images/schem-3.png)

The core mechanism operates through an automated market maker (AMM) for each subnet, which includes two reserves:

- **TAO Reserves** (œÑ_in) ‚Äî the pool of staked **TAO**  
- **Alpha Reserves** (Œ±_in) ‚Äî the pool of **Œ±-tokens**  
- Price: `Price = œÑ_in/Œ±_in`  
- An automatic exchange mechanism exists between the reserves  

**Emission in Dynamic TAO**  
With the introduction of **Dynamic TAO**, liquidity is gradually emitted into the Bittensor token economy according to an algorithm designed to encourage growth, stabilize prices, and protect against manipulation.

Each block:

- The network emits **TAO** and adds it to the **TAO reserves** of subnets.  
- The network emits **alpha tokens** at double the base emission rate. These emitted **alpha tokens** are distributed between:  
  - The **subnet‚Äôs alpha reserve** (increasing available liquidity)  
  - **Alpha outstanding** (incentives for miners, validators, subnet creators, and stakers)  

This mechanism creates a dynamic market economy where token emission is based on demand for computational power, helping stabilize prices and fostering healthy competition among subnets.

For more details, including formulas and examples, see [here](https://docs.bittensor.com/dynamic-tao/dtao-guide).

**Connection with Yuma Consensus**

**Yuma Consensus** previously played a key role in evaluating miner performance by ensuring consistency in validator scores. With the transition to **Dynamic TAO**, the system has become more decentralized and market-driven. However, Yuma Consensus is still used within subnets to align validator evaluations and determine the quality of miners' work. Now, this mechanism works in tandem with Dynamic TAO ‚Äî Yuma handles consensus within a subnet, while Dynamic TAO defines the value of the subnets themselves through market mechanisms.

The value of each subnet is determined through TAO staking (via AMM exchange and alpha-token staking), where network participants can "vote" on a subnet‚Äôs value. This allows:
- Network participants to influence the price and relative value of subnets  
- Miners and validators to operate in a dynamic economy where the subnet's value changes based on demand and liquidity

The reward system is now based on the market value of each subnet‚Äôs alpha tokens. As subnets grow in popularity and attract more TAO, the price of their alpha tokens increases, leading to higher TAO emissions.

Rewards are distributed in alpha tokens, which network participants can convert into TAO. This process can affect the price of alpha tokens, which in turn impacts future rewards.

Dynamic TAO ensures fair reward distribution by aligning it with the real value of each subnet. This creates a self-regulating economy where market mechanisms incentivize higher-quality computations and efficient performance.

## 4. Miners, Validators, Subnet Creators, and Nominators

- Maybe you're wondering: can I create my own miner to perform specific tasks and earn rewards?  
- Or maybe you want to become a validator, evaluate miners‚Äô work, and earn rewards for it?  
- Perhaps you have an idea for a task that could be run in a new subnet and generate revenue?  
- Are you a TAO token holder looking to earn passive income?

We‚Äôll answer all of these questions below.

**How to Become a Miner**

To become a miner, you first need suitable hardware.  
Each subnet has its own requirements, but for a general idea, you can check out the template for subnet creators. It includes general [requirements](https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor-subnet-template/blob/main/min_compute.yml) for setting up miners and validators.

Registration requires a payment in TAO tokens.

Each subnet can contain a maximum of 64 validators and 192 miners.

Once you register and receive an identification number, you enter an _immunity_period_ which gives you protection from delisting for a certain number of blocks. After this grace period ends, if a miner has the lowest performance metrics, they will be delisted and replaced by a new miner.  
For more details, see [here](https://docs.bittensor.com/miners/).

So, if you have the opportunity to become a miner to perform specific tasks ‚Äî whether it's providing an AI model, GPU power, or data storage for certain purposes ‚Äî you can join the network and start earning.

**How to Become a Validator**

To register as a validator, similar to miners, each subnet has its own hardware requirements.

First, you need to register in the subnet and stake 1000 TAO tokens.

After that, you can start using the evaluation mechanism for miners‚Äô work that is defined within the subnet.

For more details, read [here](https://docs.bittensor.com/validators/).

**How to Become a Nominator**

A nominator can be thought of as a delegator or staker for a specific subnet and validator.

As we mentioned earlier, a validator‚Äôs voting power in evaluating miner performance depends on the amount of stake delegated to them ‚Äî and this directly impacts the size of the token emission they receive. 
 
So, to increase their share of blockchain emissions, a validator can attract TAO stakers. These stakers will also earn dividends from the subnet‚Äôs total emissions, proportional to their stake.

You can stake through:
- [Bittensor SDK](https://docs.bittensor.com/staking-and-delegation/managing-stake-sdk)
- [Bittensor CLI](https://docs.bittensor.com/staking-and-delegation/managing-stake-btcli)
- [Polkadot js](https://docs.bittensor.com/staking-and-delegation/staking-polkadot-js)
- [Ledger Hardware](https://docs.bittensor.com/staking-and-delegation/using-ledger-hw-wallet)
- [precompile evm contract](https://docs.bittensor.com/evm-tutorials/staking-precompile)

To check the emission a specific subnet is receiving ‚Äî and choose one for staking ‚Äî you can go [here](https://taostats.io/subnets).

**Subnet Creators**

For subnet creators, it‚Äôs recommended to first test the reward mechanism locally, then deploy the subnet to the testnet, and only after that to the mainnet.

To create a subnet, you need to install the Bittensor SDK and set up a wallet using the Bittensor wallet.

Then, with a sufficient balance, you can create a subnet via the SDK and start inviting miners and validators to work on your task.

## 4. Limitations and Issues in the Bittensor Network

Despite its unique and ambitious approach, Bittensor faces several limitations and points of centralized control. Let‚Äôs look at the key challenges and the efforts to overcome them.

### 4.1 Proof of Authority (PoA) Mechanism

The core blockchain system, Subtensor, uses the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, where transaction validation is performed only by trusted nodes controlled by the Opentensor Foundation. This raises decentralization concerns, as the Opentensor Foundation has full control over the network, including the ability to censor transactions.

To achieve full decentralization, a transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) is planned. However, the timeline for implementing this system is still unknown.

### 4.2 Blockchain Size

As the network and number of subnets grow, so does the size of the blockchain. Light nodes require 128 GB of storage, while archive nodes need around 1.5 TB. It was projected that by 2025, the size of a light node could reach 1 TB, which may hinder decentralization if validation becomes open to all.  
However, this hasn‚Äôt happened yet, and it‚Äôs important to note that for most tasks, light nodes are sufficient for miners and validators.

As of February 2025:  
- Light node: 128 GB is sufficient  
- Archive node: minimum 2 TB required for the current chain size, at block #5029000 on February 28, 2025.

### 4.3 Bittensor Governance

Bittensor governance is concentrated in the hands of a few key actors:
- **The Triumvirate**: Consists of three members of the Opentensor Foundation who are responsible for proposing network updates.  
- **The Senate**: Votes on proposals from the Triumvirate and includes 12 validators with the highest amount of delegated TAO.

Centralized governance may lead to rule manipulation in favor of a limited group of participants. The Opentensor Foundation plans to make governance more open to reduce the risks of centralization.

## 5. Bittensor Ecosystem

Bittensor has a unique architecture based on subnets, which allows for the creation of diverse and ambitious projects. Each subnet can be aimed at either commercial use or scientific research across various domains.

**Subnet Categories**

1. **Commercial Subnets**: Offer services aimed at generating profit, for example, integrating miner outputs into third-party applications.  
2. **Scientific Subnets**: Support research in non-financial fields such as biology, medicine, and technology.

Our overview of subnets will include the top ones by market cap from [this](https://taostats.io/subnets) list.

Let‚Äôs briefly talk about the dashboard interface using [Subnet #64](https://taostats.io/subnets/64/chart) as an example:

Let‚Äôs explain the chart and the buy/sell buttons.

As we mentioned earlier, each subnet is an AMM pool. The first asset is the TAO token, and the second is the subnet‚Äôs native token. The chart shows the price of the TAO token in the pool relative to the subnet token.

The value of the TAO token is regulated by the market. So when a subnet becomes popular or in demand, people deposit their TAO and withdraw the subnet token.  
As a result, the amount of TAO in the pool increases, and the amount of the subnet token decreases.

As a result, the price of the subnet token increases.  
Then all holders of the subnet token ‚Äî miners, validators, stakers, and the subnet creator ‚Äî can choose to exchange their reward tokens back into TAO, thereby realizing a profit.

In this way, a subnet‚Äôs AMM pool can be used for token swaps, staking, or cashing out profits for your work/contribution.

Let‚Äôs move on to reviewing subnets and their applications to understand how they can be used.

## Bittensor: Real Value of Decentralized AI for Users

Putting aside the marketing slogans, a fair question arises: what real value does Bittensor bring to everyday users? Let‚Äôs break down the key benefits and use cases.

### Advantages of Bittensor

**Access to various AI models without relying on a single provider**  
Unlike centralized services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), Bittensor gives access to multiple models through a single interface.  
This means:
- Independence from the policies and pricing strategies of a single company  
- The ability to choose the best model for a specific task  
- Flexibility to switch between models based on your needs

**Economic Benefits**
- Transparent pricing ‚Äî usage costs are determined by market mechanisms, not corporate decisions  
- Pay-as-you-go ‚Äî most services operate on a usage-based model with no fixed subscription fees  
- Monetization opportunity ‚Äî hardware owners can rent out their resources and earn rewards  

So, the main points are:
- **Censorship resistance** ‚Äî a decentralized network is harder to control externally  
- **Fault tolerance** ‚Äî no single point of failure makes the system more reliable  
- **Innovation** ‚Äî an open ecosystem encourages the development of new models and algorithms  

### Example Use Cases

**App Developer**  
A developer can use Bittensor instead of relying on a single provider‚Äôs API (like OpenAI). For example, **Corcel (Subnet 19)** provides access to various language models through a unified API, which offers:
- Reduced cost of working with AI  
- Easy switching between models  
- Independence from a single provider‚Äôs policies

**Data Researcher**  
Training AI models requires large volumes of data.

**Data Universe (Subnet 13)** offers:
- Decentralized data storage  
- Access to unique datasets  
- Fresh and up-to-date data continuously updated by miners  

**Everyday AI User**  
When searching for information, reliability matters.

**Sybil (Subnet 4)** offers:
- Answers with verified sources  
- Minimization of misinformation from AI  
- The ability to trace the origin of data

### Potential Future Applications

_AI Agents:_

Bittensor enables the creation of AI agents capable of performing complex tasks. For example, a travel planning AI agent could:

1. Analyze user preferences  
2. Search for flights via APIs  
3. Check the weather forecast  
4. Find hotels based on reviews  
5. Build a travel itinerary  

Such an agent could use multiple subnets: one for processing the request, another for information retrieval, and a third for building the optimal route.

_Path to AGI:_

It‚Äôs possible that **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** will be achieved through the integration of many specialized models.  
Bittensor is moving in that direction by creating:

1. **Specialized models** ‚Äî each subnet solves a specific task  
2. **Combined capabilities** ‚Äî AI agents can interact with each other  
3. **Market-driven growth** ‚Äî the best models attract more resources and evolve faster  
4. **Collective intelligence** ‚Äî thousands of independent participants contribute to a powerful AI system  

Thus, Bittensor is not just a blockchain for AI ‚Äî it‚Äôs the foundation for a new decentralized AI ecosystem, where innovation is driven by the community, not centralized corporations.

## Conclusion

Bittensor is building a revolutionary decentralized infrastructure for artificial intelligence, where value is defined by market forces rather than corporate decisions.  
The subnet architecture provides unprecedented flexibility, enabling the creation of specialized networks for a wide range of tasks ‚Äî from text processing to image analysis.
