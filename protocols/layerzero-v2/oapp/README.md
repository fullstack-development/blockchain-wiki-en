# Interacting with the LayerZero v2 Protocol. Part 1. Simple OApp in Remix

**Author:** [Roman Yarlykov](https://github.com/rlkvrv) üßê

If you've already read the article on the LayerZero protocol architecture, the next step is to try it in action. The easiest way to do this is to deploy smart contracts in [Remix IDE](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), configure them, and send a simple message. This will help you understand what a basic OApp is, how it works, and why it's needed.

Terminology:

- **Source network** ‚Äì the blockchain that sends data to another network.
- **Destination network** ‚Äì the blockchain that receives data from the source network.
- **OApp** (Omnichain Application) ‚Äì an omnichain application with all necessary interfaces for sending and receiving messages.
- **EID** ‚Äì Endpoint ID. An endpoint is a smart contract that handles all incoming and outgoing messages in any network.
- **ZRO** ‚Äì the utility token of the LayerZero platform, also used for governance voting.
- **Executor** ‚Äì also called the executor, a smart contract that executes the message delivery transaction in the destination network.

## Creating a Simple OApp

In the [documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/getting-started#example-omnichain-application), it's suggested to deploy two smart contracts: `SourceOApp` and `DestinationOApp`, which send messages between blockchains using Remix (see the _Example Omnichain Application_ section). These contracts are already written ‚Äî you just need to deploy and configure them.

Just in case, I'm duplicating the Remix links here, since the documentation often gets updated:

- [SourceOApp](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.layerzero.network/LayerZero/contracts/Source.sol&lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a.js)
- [DestinationOApp](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.layerzero.network/LayerZero/contracts/Destination.sol&lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a.js)

These are two very simple smart contracts. `SourceOApp` inherits from [OAppSender](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/blob/main/packages/oapp-evm/contracts/oapp/OAppSender.sol), and `DestinationOApp` inherits from [OAppReceiver](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/blob/main/packages/oapp-evm/contracts/oapp/OAppReceiver.sol).

Our task is to send a simple message (a string) from one blockchain to another.

What do we need? Actually, not much:

1. Two OApp applications deployed on different blockchains (`SourceOApp` and `DestinationOApp`).
2. The `Endpoint` addresses in both networks, as well as their `EID` (Endpoint ID). You can find them in [this table](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/deployed-contracts).

### Source OApp

Take a look at the `SourceOApp` code (in Remix) ‚Äî it's pretty straightforward. We're interested in two functions:

- `SourceOApp::quote` ‚Äî allows you to calculate how much native token needs to be sent to the destination network to cover transaction execution and security stack checks. The `_payInLzToken` parameter is set if the payment will be made _not_ in the network's native token (but for example using the protocol's ZRO ERC20 token).

```solidity
function quote(
    uint32 _dstEid,
    string memory _message,
    bool _payInLzToken
) public view returns (MessagingFee memory fee) {
    bytes memory payload = abi.encode(_message);
    fee = _quote(_dstEid, payload, _options, _payInLzToken);
}
```

- `SourceOApp::send` ‚Äî sends the message and transfers native tokens to pay for gas in the destination network.

```solidity
function send(
    uint32 _dstEid,
    string memory _message
) external payable {
    // Encode the message before calling _lzSend.
    bytes memory _encodedMessage = abi.encode(_message);
    _lzSend(
        _dstEid,
        _encodedMessage,
        _options,
        // The fee is paid in the native token (or in the ZRO token).
        MessagingFee(msg.value, 0),
        // Sender's address in the source network (in case the fee needs to be refunded).
        payable(msg.sender)
    );
    emit MessageSent(_message, _dstEid);
}
```

### Basic OApp Setup

The `Endpoint` address is set during contract deployment. After deployment, you also need to link the smart contracts by calling `SourceOApp::setPeer(uint32 eid, bytes32 peer)` in both contracts (in the source network and in the destination network).

_Note:_ A peer in this context means an OApp. Two OApps can exchange messages only if they have a **peer-to-peer** connection via `eid` and the contract address. The `setPeer` function is located in the `OAppCore` smart contract.

_Important!_ `SourceOApp::setPeer` accepts the address in `bytes32` format. This is intentional, since address formats can vary between blockchains (for example, it's 20 bytes in EVM and 32 bytes in Solana).

![remix-set-peer](./img/remix-set-peer.png)

To convert an EVM address to `bytes32`, you can use the following function:

```solidity
function addressToBytes32(address _addr) public pure returns (bytes32) {
    return bytes32(uint256(uint160(_addr)));
}
```

After the transaction is executed, you can verify that the `peer` is set correctly.

![remix-get-peer](./img/remix-get-peer.png)

_Note:_ `EID` is necessary because not all blockchains have a `chain ID`.

### Destination OApp

In the destination OApp network, there's one key function we're interested in ‚Äî `_lzReceive`. It‚Äôs overridden to handle specific types of messages. In our case, it's a plain string.

```solidity
function _lzReceive(
    Origin calldata _origin,
    bytes32 /*_guid*/,
    bytes calldata message,
    address /*executor*/,  // Executor address specified for the OApp.
    bytes calldata /*_extraData*/  // Any additional data or options.
) internal override {
    // Decode the payload to get the message.
    data = abi.decode(message, (string));
    emit MessageReceived(data, _origin.srcEid, _origin.sender, _origin.nonce);
}
```

### Practical Part

Now let's go through all the steps from the documentation to deploy the applications and send a message. For a deeper experience, I recommend using other blockchains from [this list](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/deployed-contracts) instead of the ones suggested in the documentation.

_Note:_ copy the contract addresses right after deployment, and also use "Pin contract for current workspace" ‚Äî click the corresponding icon next to the contract address, because in Remix, if you switch to another network, the deployed contracts are reset (even if the tab stays open).

Reminder: to access the functions of an already deployed contract in Remix, select the contract in the **Contract** tab and paste its address into **At Address**.

![remix-at-address](./img/remix-at-address.png)

Steps to follow:

1. Choose two blockchains. Make sure you have enough native tokens to pay for gas.
2. Go to the LayerZero documentation ‚Üí [Chains](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/deployed-contracts) and find the `Endpoint` addresses and corresponding `EID`. Save them ‚Äî you'll need them later.
3. Deploy the `SourceOApp` contract to the **source network**. You'll need the `Endpoint` address for that network.
4. Deploy the `DestinationOApp` contract to the **destination network**, also using the corresponding `Endpoint`. Save the address.
5. Switch back to the source network and convert the addresses to `bytes32` format. To do this, call `Source::addressToBytes32` (for both the OApp in the source network and the one in the destination).
6. Link the OApps using `setPeer` by executing two transactions:
   - `Source::setPeer(uint32 eid, bytes32 peer)`
   - `Destination::setPeer(uint32 eid, bytes32 peer)`
7. Calculate how many native tokens are needed to pay for gas in the destination network. Use `Source::quote(uint32 dstEid, string message, bool payLzToken)` for that. You can set the `payLzToken` parameter to `false`.

   ![remix-quote](./img/remix-quote.png)

8. Paste the calculated `fee` (amount in Wei) into the **Value** field in Remix and send the message using `Source::send(uint32 dstEid, string message)`.

   ![remix-value](./img/remix-value.png)  
   ![remix-send](./img/remix-send.png)

9. Check the transaction on [testnet.layerzeroscan.com](https://testnet.layerzeroscan.com/). Search by the transaction hash (you can find it in the Remix logs).

   ![remix-tx-hash](./img/remix-tx-hash.png)  
   ![layerzero-scan-tx](./img/layerzero-scan-tx.png)

10. Right after the transaction is sent, the status in the explorer will be **Inflight**. After a few minutes, if everything went well, the status will change to **Delivered**. In the destination network, you can check the received message using `Destination::data`.

    ![remix-data](./img/remix-data.png)

_Note:_ if you have a bit of ETH on **Arbitrum** and POL on **Polygon**, you can use the smart contracts I deployed and see how it works on mainnet. It'll only cost a few cents, but sometimes it's easier to pay than to hunt for test tokens.

To do this:

- Open Remix.
- Connect to the contracts using the addresses provided below (via **At Address**).
- Send a text message.

**Important:** works only in one direction ‚Äî **Arbitrum ‚Üí Polygon**.

Smart contracts:

- **Arbitrum:**
  - `SourceOApp`: `0x6b5ebc0bdb2572533f1cbe09026663a524421594`
  - `EID`: `30110`
- **Polygon:**
  - `DestinationOApp`: `0x0c02cb84eef5f3ea61be9dfec7f884dffc1fa6c0`
  - `EID`: `30109`

Example transactions:

- [Example 1](https://layerzeroscan.com/tx/0x55615e9ee9be40614756fed61af5e5ad35b4e63cceefce4e3d49a6ccf0cf9f95)
- [Example 2](https://layerzeroscan.com/tx/0x9124aa03fefd50d7d2345c941e7e9e26c41d1b98023326548ce5346c0fa22257)

When you're working on mainnet, you naturally start doing everything more carefully and dive deeper into the details. Though even that doesn‚Äôt always save you from mistakes üòÅ. For example, I messed up a few times ‚Äî entered the wrong `EID` and forgot to send native tokens. So I definitely recommend giving it a try!

## Conclusion

Now you can deploy `DestinationOApp` to any other blockchain (including non-EVM networks), add a new `peer` to `SourceOApp`, and start sending messages there.

This was kind of a warm-up. Maybe this will be enough for you, but if you want to dive deeper into OApp, I wrote a separate article on creating an OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token). An OFT is also an OApp, just with additional logic for transferring tokens between networks. That will be part 2.
